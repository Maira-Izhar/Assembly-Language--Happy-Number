# Assembly-Language--Happy-Number
This is an Assembly Language code used to identify a Happy Number. A happy number is defined by
the following process:
Starting with the given number, replace that number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process on the replaced number until the number either equals 1 within 256
iterations of the process. The number for which this process ends in 1 within 256 iterations is
called a happy number, otherwise it is called an unhappy number.
